The businesses are in the leisure market such as restaurants and cinemas.  \nWe will use the Foursquare API to examine the Neighbourhoods of Seattle to find the best locations for these businesses, based on the existing businesses and services in those areas.  This will allow the busineses to choose a location to open.\nThe target audience here is both existing businesses looking for new locations and new start ups in the locality."
